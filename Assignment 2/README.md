## Possible Solutions to the Problem

1. Since we need Non-Linear Lower Dimensional Representation of Image, we can use tradisinal Solutions like TSNE to reduce size. But these algorithms doesn't take image content in Consideration and often time end up loosing valuable Informations in image.
2. Siamese Network - Implemented
3. Variational Autoencoders - Implemented
