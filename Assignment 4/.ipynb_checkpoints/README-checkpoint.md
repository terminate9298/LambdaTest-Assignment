# Assignment 4
##### Solve cart-pole problem using open-AI gym environment.

## Agent-Critic Model
In this Reinforcement Learning, we followed Agent Critic Model. Agent and Critic learn to perform their tasks, such that the recommended actions from the actor maximize the rewards. As an agent takes actions and moves through an environment, it learns to map the observed state of the environment. 

## CartPole-V0
A pole is attached to a cart placed on a frictionless track. The agent has to apply force to move the cart. It is rewarded for every time step the pole remains upright. The agent, therefore, must learn to keep the pole from falling over.
